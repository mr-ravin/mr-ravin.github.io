- 🎮 <i><b>Indie-Game Developer</b></i>: 
  - [x] [Rotation Wars 2](https://github.com/mr-ravin/rotationwars2): An open-source, minimalistic multiplayer game built with **Unity3D** for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ravin.developer.rotationwars2), Linux, and [Web Browser](https://ravinkumar.itch.io/rotationwars2). Players battle on a dynamically rotating platform, pushing and maneuvering to stay on while knocking opponents off. The last player standing wins.
  - [x] [QRGAME](https://github.com/mr-ravin/QRGame): QRGame is a minimalist, terminal-typing based open-source video game where the player must quickly type a displayed key and press Enter before time runs out. As players advance, the time to respond shortens, pushing speed and accuracy to the limit. A single mistake ends the game, keeping the tension high as the challenge intensifies. True to its name, QRGame can be stored entirely within a simple QR code, making it easy to share and quick to start!
